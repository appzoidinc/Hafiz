# Quran Hafiz

Quran Hafiz, or Hafiz, is a website designed to make memorization of the Holy Qur'an easier. The website is currently hosted at quranhafiz.azurewebsites.net

The website uses ASP.NET Core MVC and is coded in the C# programming language. Current available modes are: reading, quiz, and arrange.

The quiz mode gives a quiz on the order of the ayat. The arrange mode lets you drag and drop each ayat to set the right order.
